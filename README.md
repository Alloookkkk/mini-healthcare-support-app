# Mini Healthcare Support Web App

This is a simple concept-level healthcare support web application designed for NGOs.
The goal is to help NGOs collect patient support requests or volunteer registrations
and provide basic automated assistance.

## Features

- The system can later be extended into an AI chatbot to answer FAQs such as:

This improves response time and reduces manual workload for NGO staff.
